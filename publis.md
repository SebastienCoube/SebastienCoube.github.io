- _Improving performances of MCMC for Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process models with full data augmentation_ 2021, in _Computational Statistics and Data Analysis_ a paper with a few MCMC tricks, some of which are great, other useless 
- _Nonstationary Spatial Process Models with Spatially Varying Covariance Kernels_ _In revision_ A big computational and methodological endavor towards nonstationary spatial modeling 
- _MCMC algorithms and hierarchical architectures for spatial modeling using Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Processes_ 2021 My glorious PhD manuscript
- _Sequential process to choose efficient sampling design based on partial prior information data and simulations_ 2020, in _Spatial Statistics_ Honestly, I just lent a hand on this one !
