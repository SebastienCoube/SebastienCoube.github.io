I would like to talk about a big, big piece of work I have been doing with [Sudipto Banerjee](http://sudipto.bol.ucla.edu/) and my then PhD advisor [Beno√Æt Liquet](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/benoit-liquet-weiland). The work is focused on statisical modeling of geographic data, where there is some heterogenity (*nonstationarity*) in the behavior of the interest variable. For those who are brave enough or mad enough, you can dive into [**the paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11873), which is still in revision. However, if you are more interested in case studies, you can go to the [**GitHub page**](https://github.com/SebastienCoube/Nonstat-NNGP), then download a **R package** to install on your machine, and a **vignette** that will give you a practical intuition of the model and a step-by-step guidance on how to use it. 

If you have questions, suggestions, remarks, if you want explanations, if something is unclear, if you want some help with the package, if you want me to come to your lab and talk about it (one can dream), just email me!
