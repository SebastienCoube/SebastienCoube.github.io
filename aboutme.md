I am a resarch associate in the [MathNum](https://www.inrae.fr/en/divisions/mathnum) department of INRAE, the glorious French institute for agriculture, environment, and food research. Really into Bayesian modeling and computational statistics, but also a curious person with a strong interest in health, ecology and social sciences. 

I am interested in geostatistics, in a Bayesian perspective. I like to tinker with MCMC, in particular with Interweaving and Hybrid Monte-Carlo. I have mostly worked with environmental applications, in particular contamination. I recently picked up Markov and hidden Markov modeling, a big research interest in my new lab at INRAE. 

I strive to [fly less](https://sites.tufts.edu/flyingless/).
